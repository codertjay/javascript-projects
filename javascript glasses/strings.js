// strings are dynamic in  java script it is not like pyhton where strings are inmutable
// the back slash n is for new line in js
let fruits = 'banana';
let morefruits = 'banana\napple';

console.log(fruits.big());
console.log(fruits.bold());
// we hav so many things in a string
//fruit.slice(2,5) this gives you nana
//fruit.replace('ban','123)
// fruit.split(',') thjis gives the answer in comma form this is split by a comma
//fruit.split('') this is a normal split it does not split with a comma
